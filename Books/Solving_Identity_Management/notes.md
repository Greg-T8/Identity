## 1. The Hydra of Modern Identity

> Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it. &mdash; Albert Einstein

Over time, teams maintaining an in-house identity service start to feel like they are fighting a hydra &mdash; the mythical beast from Greek mythology with nine heads. When one of her heads was cut off, two more would grow back in its place. The more you try to fix the problem, the worse it gets.

### Identity Challenges

There isn't a master solution to identity management that fits every case. 

Decisions when developing applications:
- Who are your users? And will they authenticate?
- Level of authentication strength?
- How do you provide simple but secure access?  SSO provides convenience, but can also be a single point of failure.
- Will you be migrating from legacy applications?
- Regulatory requirements?
- User experience when onboarding?

This book covers three popular identity protocols: OAuth 2, OIDC (OpenID Connect), and SAML 2.
